- 🛡️ **Audit trail** - All operations logged
- 🚫 **Access control** - Centralized ownership validation
- 📊 **Monitoring ready** - Security events tracked
- 🔄 **Backwards compatible** - No breaking changes

**📋 Security Implementation Approach - Why App-Level vs Database-Level**

**Phase 6.7 uses Enhanced Application Security (NOT Row Level Security)**

**✅ What This Plan Does (App-Level Security):**
- **No database changes** - Works with existing schema unchanged
- **No migrations needed** - Uses current tables as-is
- **No RLS policies** - Stays at application layer only
- **Backwards compatible** - All existing code continues working
- **Fast implementation** - 8-10 hours vs 20-30 hours for full RLS

**🔒 How It Achieves 80% of RLS Security Benefits:**

```typescript
// Before (current - scattered security checks):
const videos = await db.select().from(videoUploads)
  .where(eq(videoUploads.userId, session.user.id))

// After (centralized security wrapper):
const videos = await secureDb.videos.findAll(session.user.id)
// Automatically: adds userId filter + audit logging + validation
```

**Security Coverage Provided:**
- ✅ **User data isolation** - Users can only access their own data
- ✅ **API endpoint protection** - All routes verify ownership
- ✅ **Complete audit trail** - Track who accessed what, when
- ✅ **Rate limiting** - Prevents brute force and abuse attacks
- ✅ **Input validation** - Stops malicious requests and injection
- ✅ **Secure error handling** - No data leaks in error messages

**The Missing 20% (Database-Level Protection):**
- Database-level enforcement if application has bugs
- Protection against direct database access scenarios
- SQL injection backup protection layer

**Why This Approach for Payment-Ready Security:**
- **Zero risk** - No database structure changes or migrations
- **Payment secure** - Covers all realistic attack vectors for SaaS
- **Enterprise ready** - Centralized security with complete audit trail
- **Easy rollback** - Can disable security layer without data loss
- **Performance optimized** - Cached ownership checks, minimal overhead
- **Future proof** - Can add RLS later without breaking changes

**Security vs Complexity Trade-off:**
- **App-Level Security**: 8-10 hours → 80% protection → Payment ready
- **Full RLS Implementation**: 20-30 hours → 95% protection → High complexity

**Bottom Line**: This approach provides enterprise-level security without database risks, making the application secure enough for financial transactions while maintaining development velocity.

**Success Criteria for Phase 6.7**:
- [ ] All API routes use centralized security functions
- [ ] All database operations verify user ownership
- [ ] Complete audit trail of security events
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts blocked and logged
